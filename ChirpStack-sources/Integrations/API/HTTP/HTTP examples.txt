Info

Payload fields in the RESTful JSON API are / must be encoded as base64. While the data looks different from HEX encoded payloads, it is just a different way to represent binary data. A website which can help to make the conversion is ASCII to Hex.
Enqueue downlink

The following examples enqueues the base64 payload AQID (which is 010203 in HEX) for the device with DevEUI 0101010101010101. Do not forget to replace <API TOKEN> with an API token retrieved using the web-interface.

curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Grpc-Metadata-Authorization: Bearer <API TOKEN>' -d '{ \ 
   "deviceQueueItem": { \ 
     "confirmed": false, \ 
     "data": "AQID", \ 
     "fPort": 10 \ 
   } \ 
 }' 'http://localhost:8080/api/devices/0101010101010101/queue'
